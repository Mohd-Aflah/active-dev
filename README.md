## 🛡️ Security Notes

- **Never share your bot token** with anyone
- The token is only used to authenticate with Discord's API
- No personal data is collected or stored by this application

## ⚠️ Important

- Badge verification can take up to 24 hours
- Make sure your Discord server has Community features enabled
- The bot needs appropriate permissions to create slash commands

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

2. **Slash command not working**: Ensure the bot has been added to your server with the correct permissions
3. **Community server required**: Enable Community features in your Discord server settings
